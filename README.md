# Building a Random Forest - Census Income

## Scenario
Professors at a college are eager to integrate machine learning into their respective disciplines. The Economics department aims to enhance students' understanding of the interactions among various income factors. In this project, the task is to determine if an individual's income surpasses $50,000 per year using census data as a basis for the predictions.

## Project Goals
The initial objective is to determine if an individual's income surpasses $50,000 per year using census data as a basis for your prediction.

Several questions will be asked:

1. What feature contriuted the most to the outcome?

2. How accurate is the Random Forest model?

3. What are the model's precison, recall, and F1 scores?

4. What advantage does a random forest have over a single decision tree?
   



#### Why use a Random Forest model to predict the classification?
Ensemble learning is a fascinating approach in machine learning that combines the predictions from several models to enhance overall accuracy. By leveraging the strengths of multiple models, this technique aims to produce more reliable predictions than any single model could achieve on its own. When different models, particularly those that vary in their design, are brought together, the result is often a significant improvement in estimation quality.

One popular example of ensemble learning is the random forest method, which merges the outputs of numerous decision tree models. In this approach, the final decision can be determined by either taking the most common classification from all the trees or calculating the average of their predictions for regression tasks.


## Data
A dataset that can be used to train the machine-learning model has been found. It is a CSV file containing 32561 census records. 


## Conclusions
